## Become an Official LooperLands Creator

### **Onboard as a Creator**

- **Join the Discord:** Start by joining the [LooperLands Discord community](https://discord.gg/QRqDEqsNjT).

- **Reach Out to Peteszah:** In your ticket, express your interest in becoming a creator, introduce yourself, and tag @Peteszah.
- **Keep watch but carry on:** Monitor your ticket for updates, but don’t hesitate to start creating in the meantime.

### **Download the Templates**

- **Download Link:** Access and download the templates [here](http://cobmin.com/downloads/Templates.zip).
- **Templates Overview:**
  - **Loopers:** Sprite sheet (160x288), Frame size (32x32) - perfect for character animations.
  - **Weapons:** Sprite sheet (240x432), Frame size (48x48) - create diverse weaponry.

Use these templates as a foundation for your pixel art creations, customizing them to bring your unique ideas to life in the world of LooperLands.

### Sprite Layout Overview

The sprite sheets for Loopers, weapons, and Fishing Rods follow a structured layout to represent different states and actions of the characters and tools. Here's the order from top to bottom:

- Attack Right: The sprite's attacking animation facing right.
- Walk Right: The sprite's walking animation moving right.
- Idle Right: The sprite in a standing (idle) pose facing right.
- Attack Up: The sprite's attacking animation facing upwards.
- Walk Up: The sprite's walking animation moving up.
- Idle Up: The sprite in a standing (idle) pose facing upwards.
- Attack Down: The sprite's attacking animation facing downwards.
- Walk Down: The sprite's walking animation moving down.
- Idle Down: The sprite in a standing (idle) pose facing downwards.

For Fishing Rods, replace the 'Attack' animations with 'Casting' to depict the action of casting the fishing line in different directions.

## Create Your Sprites

![Creating Sprites](/blog-images/Bring-Pixel-Art-to-Life/Aseprite.png)
Creating sprites is a cornerstone of bringing your pixel art to life in LooperLands. I personally use Aseprite for its effectiveness in pixel art creation and sprite management. However, the community uses a diverse range of tools, and I've listed some popular alternatives below for you to explore.

### **Choosing Your Software**

- **Pixel Art Specific Tools:**
  - Aseprite (purchase): My personal favorite, offering robust features for pixel art. Visit [www.aseprite.org](https://www.aseprite.org/).
  - PixelStudio (free): A versatile tool for Android and Apple users. Ideal for crafting pixel art on the go. [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.PixelStudio&pli=1) | [Apple](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pixel-studio-for-pixel-art/id1404203859).
- **General Tools:**
  - [Photopea](https://www.photopea.com/): Great for final touches and scaling item graphics with precision.
  - [EZGIF Sprite Cutter](https://ezgif.com/sprite-cutter): A diverse set of tools that's useful for various sprite creation needs.

### **Previewing Your Sprites**

## Generating Your Assets

### Single Uploads

For those who are interested in a simpler process of creating and uploading a single sprite to LooperLands, I recommend starting at Step 4 in the [Creators-101](https://discord.gg/DntWrUD3nq) guide on Discord. This method is ideal if you're starting out or prefer to focus on single creations.

- **Step 4 in Creators-101:** Perfect for single sprite creations and uploads.
- **Ease of Use:** Simplified process compared to bulk uploads, ideal for beginners.

The information below, however, is tailored towards those looking to create and upload multiple sprites at once, including making unique 1/1s or generating a variety of sprites.

### For BulkUploads: Setting Up Your Sprites in Files

![Using Maize](/blog-images/Bring-Pixel-Art-to-Life/Maize.png)

Once your sprites are crafted, it's time to bring them into the LooperLands universe. One of Maize's Premium Features plays a crucial role here, facilitating the generation of profile pictures (PFPs), metadata for minting, and preparing bulk uploads to LooperLands.

- Folder Structure: Organize your sprite files in folders as per Maize's requirements. This structure is key in determining your NFT's metadata. For detailed guidance, check out the [Maize Documentation](https://maizehelps.art/docs/tutorials/one-of-one-creation/generate-one-of-one-loopers#folder-and-file-setup).

### **Using Maize for Generation**

Maize is a versatile console application that streamlines the creation and integration of your sprites into LooperLands.

- **Multiple Options:** Whether you're looking to create a series of similar 1/1s or a range of diverse 1/1s, Maize offers the flexibility needed for your creative vision.
- **Creating Sprites and NFTs:** Maize assists in generating sprites, NFTs, metadata, and the necessary bulk upload files for LooperLands.
- **From NFTs to Sprites:** If you have pre-minted NFTs, Maize can help convert these into sprites, with metadata properties set up as key-value pairs.

#### Accessing Maize Premium Features

**Maize Premium NFT:** To use the 1/1 generation features of Maize, you must have the Maize Premium NFT, which you can purchase for 55 LRC [here](https://loopexchange.art/collection/maize-access).

For more insights into Maize's capabilities and how to use it, refer to the [documentation](https://maizehelps.art/docs/tutorials/one-of-one-creation/generate-one-of-one-loopers).

## Minting Your NFTs with Maize

Before you can upload your assets to LooperLands, you need to mint them as NFTs on [Loopring](https://loopring.io/#/). This crucial step turns your digital creations into unique, tradeable assets within the blockchain ecosystem.

- **Minting with Maize:** Maize simplifies the minting process. It has already generated the metadata and images from the sprites you've created in the above step. Now you will mint those using Maize. Visit the [minting tutorial](https://maizehelps.art/docs/tutorials/minting/bulk-minting).
- **Ready for Upload:** Once minted, your NFTs are ready to be part of the bulk upload process to LooperLands.

---

## Uploading to LooperLands

### **Utilizing Discord for Upload**

Once Maize has generated your PFPs, metadata, and minted your NFTs, it compiles all necessary files into a ZIP file for bulk upload.

- **BulkUploadFolder:** After generation, you'll receive a ZIP file containing everything needed for a bulk upload to LooperLands.
- **Step-by-Step Upload Process:** A readme file is included in the ZIP with detailed steps for the upload process. Follow these instructions to seamlessly upload your creations to LooperLands.
- **Asset Submission Fee:** Once your assets are submitted, send the asset submission fee to looperlands.loopring.eth.
- **Transaction Confirmation:** Post a picture of your transaction in the ⁠looperlands-order-submissions channel on Discord.
- **Queue and Merging:** Submissions are typically merged into the game around 8 AM EST each morning. You can view submissions currently in the queue [here](https://loopworms.io/DEV/LooperLands/AddNewLooper/CreatorReportFile.html).

By following these steps and utilizing Maize's capabilities, you can efficiently integrate your creative works into the LooperLands ecosystem, enriching the game with your unique artistic contributions.
