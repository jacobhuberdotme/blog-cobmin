### What Is Alpha Fields?

Alpha Fields isn't just a feature or a zone within Cob's Farm; it's the first iteration of the game itself. This is where the tranquil world of farming and the heart-pounding excitement of dungeon battles come to life. It's a live testing ground, providing real-time insights into gameplay elements and mechanics.

### The Purpose of Alpha Fields

The primary aim of launching Alpha Fields is to build all the necessary functionalities for the game. It's a crucial phase in the game development process, acting as both a creative and technical proving ground. Here, both I and you, the players, can engage, experiment, and test new ideas to shape the future of Cob's Farm.

### The Alpha Fields Experience

In this space, you'll find a rich set of activities that are indicative of what Cob's Farm will eventually offer. Whether you're interested in farming, fishing, commerce, or combat, Alpha Fields serves as a comprehensive preview.

## Access and Ownership

### Closed Alpha

Alpha Fields is currently in a closed alpha stage, accessible exclusively to those who own a CobLooper or a weapon from the [Cob’s Farm collection](https://loopexchange.art/collection/cobsfarm). These aren't just in-game assets; they're NFTs on the [Loopring blockchain](https://loopring.io/#/), providing true ownership and investment opportunities. This decision to restrict initial access serves a purpose: it creates an intimate testing environment where only the most dedicated and invested players can explore, give feedback, and influence the development of Cob’s Farm.

Expect more drops to come as we progress.

### The Value of NFTs and Loopring Blockchain

Your assets in Cob's Farm are more than just pixels on a screen; they're NFTs minted on the Loopring blockchain. Loopring is a Layer 2 blockchain built on Ethereum, offering Ethereum-equivalent security but with significantly lower transaction costs. This means you have true ownership of unique characters and weapons, which could even appreciate over time. Plus, the NFTs are fully under your control, allowing you to buy, trade, or sell them as you wish.
