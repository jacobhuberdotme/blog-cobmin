## Getting Started:

First, equip yourself with a Fishing Pole, available for purchase at [LoopExchange](https://loopexchange.art/profile/0x76ac0743cf374094b222727570e2f22d879de8c7). Then, head over to [Cob's Farm](https://www.cobsfarm.com/) to find and catch the goldfish. Remember, not all waters contain goldfish so you will have to do your best to find this rare fish.

## Fishing Mechanics: Basics

![Fishing in Cob's Farm](/blog-images/The-Golden-Fin-Challenge/Fishing_CobsFarmLake.png)

- Equipping the Rod: Fishing requires a fishing rod NFT. Find it in your inventory under the Tools section. Note: You can't attack while the rod is equipped.
- Finding Fishable Water: Fishable tiles are marked with a purple highlight. The cursor changes to a bobber on these tiles.
- Casting Your Line: Click on the tile to cast your line or use WASD.
- The Waiting Game: Wait for 6 to 12 seconds, and then a fishing bar will appear, displaying a random fish.
- Catching the Fish: The fish moves in a set pattern. Your goal is to stop it in the green area of the bar. Miss the mark, and the fish escapes, leaving you empty-handed.
